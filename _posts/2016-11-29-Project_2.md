Yesterday I made a project related with Object Oriented Programming. It was quiet hard because it was my first time of creating such a type of code, however it turned to be very interesting and exciting.
At first it was difficult to understand what class means, but then I saw the lught. Class is just an abstract form of another "objects", which is called instances. It is a drawing and instances work like parts, that were made using this drawing. 
Every class has it's own attributes and methods, which initialize classes and provide connections between them. 
Doing this project reminded me playing with Lego, when you create something greate from blocks which look almost the same. It was fun!
I did't finish my project, I wish I had only one day after I understood how this system works, because it is a huge field for imagination and more deep studying. I hope I find free time to complete it as desighened. 

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
